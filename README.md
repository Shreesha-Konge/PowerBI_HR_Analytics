# PowerBI_HR_Analytics
I have created my first interactive Dashboard on HR Analytics using Power BI.
Objective: 
By using data-driven insights, help an organization by enhancing staff performance, increasing employee retention, and lowering attrition.

Dashboard Overview: 
Department Level Filter - Human Resources, Research & Development, Sales.
Performance Indicators (KPIs) â€“ Count of employees, attrition figures, attrition rate, average age of employees, average salary of employees, and average year of employees at the company.
Used Area chart, Stacked bar charts, Stacked column chart, Donut chart and Matrix visuals.

Action: 
Data Cleaning: Use Power Query Editor to clean the irrelevant and unused data such as removing duplicates, renaming columns, and changing data types. 
Data Processing: Load and Apply the cleaned data into Power BI.
Data Visualization: Create Measures and columns Using DAX functions such as count, sum, calculate, etc.

Project Learnings :
1) Identified key factors to reduce attrition.
2) Improved the hiring process.
3) Improved employee experience.
4) Made workforce more productive.
5) Gained employee trust.

Insights :
1) Maximum attrition happening in the age group 26-35.
2) The attrition rate seems to be high after working for a year in the company.
3) The attrition rate is highest for employees who are paid up to 5K.
4) Attrition is directly proportional to job satisfaction as well for different job roles. Hence lower the number, the more chances of attrition.
5) A laboratory technician's position has the highest attrition rate, i.e. 62.
6) The attrition rate is higher for male employees than for female employees.

By providing these insights, the dashboard enables HR managers to take proactive measures to retain top talent, manage attrition, and create a more productive work environment.
